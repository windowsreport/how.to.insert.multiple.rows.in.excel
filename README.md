Microsoft Excel is a widely used spreadsheet software, developed by Microsoft. To some, Excel is an easy program to use, while many first-timers struggle with the easiest tasks.

In case you are having trouble with how to insert multiple rows in Excel, here are some methods that could help you.

## 1. Manually Inserting Rows

* Select the rows equal to the number of empty rows you want to add. Keep in mind that the rows are always added above your selection.
* When making the selection in Excel, make sure that you select the numbers on the left of the screen, instead of the actual rows and columns.
* Right-click on your selection.
* Then click on Insert, and the empty rows are automatically added.
* If you select multiple rows instead of the numbers on the left side, you will get a small Insert window. Click on Entire row and then OK.

## 2. Inserting Rows With a Shortcut

* Select multiple rows in Excel, above which you want to add empty rows.
* Press Ctrl + Shift + =
* The rows should be automatically added, or you will have to select the entire row and click on OK.

## 3. Inserting Rows Through the Quick Access Toolbar

* Select the rows above which you want to add empty rows.
* Press and release the Alt key.
* Then consecutively press H, I, and E on your keyboard. The rows should be automatically added.
* If nothing happens, press R additionally, then select Entire row, and click on OK.

## 4. Using the F4 Key

* In case you want to insert just one row, right-click on the number above which you want to insert the empty row.
* Click on Insert.
* If you press the F4 key on your keyboard, you can keep adding empty rows.

## 5. Using Shortcuts to Automatically Add Rows

* Click on the row above which you want to add an empty row.
* On your keyboard, press Alt + I, and then press R.
* A row should be automatically added, and at this point, you can keep pressing F4 to add more if needed.

## 6. Inserting Multiple Rows in Different Lines Simultaneously

* If you wish to insert an empty row above a couple of rows of data at the same time, you can select them by holding the Ctrl button and clicking on the numbers on the left side.
* Once you have selected the rows above which you want to add empty rows, right-click on the cells, and click on Insert.

## 7. Inserting Blank Rows Between Data

* Besides your table, you first need to create another column. You can name it whatever you want, and make it numbered.
* To do this, input the first three numbers, then select those numbers, and double-click on the right corner of the selection. This will automatically continue the numeration for the rest of your rows.
* Then copy that numbered column and paste it below.
* Select everything, and go to Data > Sort.
* In the window that pops up, for Sort by, select the name of the column with the Numbers.
* Then click OK, and your table should have an empty row after every row with data.
